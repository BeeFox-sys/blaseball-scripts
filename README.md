# Blaseball Scripts

## Contributing

Feel free to make a pr with your script into the relevant catagory, or create a new catagory.
Scripts that automate betting are unsplortsmanlike and banned.
If your code has more instructions then just copy/paste, for example running a function, detail those instructions at the top of the file in a comment. For Example:

```js
//INSTRUCTIONS
//Once loaded, run the function echo("Hello World"), replacing the text "Hello World" with whatever you want echoed
```
